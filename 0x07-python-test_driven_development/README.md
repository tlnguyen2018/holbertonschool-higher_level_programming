What you should learn from this project
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why Python programming is awesome (dont forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
Whats an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases
Requirements for Python scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Requirements for Python test cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
example: guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x07$ python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/0-add_integer.txt
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you dont miss any edge case
