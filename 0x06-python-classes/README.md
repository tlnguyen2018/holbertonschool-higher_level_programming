Readme
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). Its VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2-3 hours if you take the time to read and understand everything.

Read or watch in this order:

A simple introduction to Object Oriented Programming without going into much detail:
Read everything until the paragraph Inheritance excluded
You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet
Object-Oriented Programming. Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs:
General Introduction
First-class Everything
A Minimal Class in Python
Attributes
You DONT have to learn about class attributes
Methods
The __init__ Method
Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
Public, Protected, and Private Attributes
Properties vs. Getters and Setters
TL;DR; - A good wrap-up video about everything you need to know for this project: Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming

Last thing: Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings
